# Week 05

Class review of NCCU-CS Linear Algebra week 5.

## Intro

This is 108703015's Linear Algebra homework. Seperated into two parts:

 - [Homework](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/tree/master/week05/programmingHW)
 - [Introspection](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/tree/master/week05#introspection)

### Working environments

 - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Python version: 3.6.9

## Homework

[Here's](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/blob/master/week05/programmingHW/code.py) the source code of this week's homework.  
Trying my best on making a class review.

### Before we started...

If you want to tryout my code, make sure you have [python3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download), [numpy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html), and [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1654/) installed on your system. If you have no idea what they are, please click them for installing guides.

## Introspection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this week's course, Mr.Tsai has taught us some basics about the linear system and group. This part was not included in senior high school courses, so I do facing some challenges doing homeworks. Fortunately, I can watch the course again on Mr.Tsai's Youtube channel. Thanks to Mr.Tsai, I can keep up with the class although I missed a class one week earlier.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me: *"Why do you want to finish your homework in this form? It spent much more time than the normal ways!"*  
I will give you the answer: *"Because I think this is cool, and I think this course is worthwhile to spent time on. That's it."*
