# Week 12

Class review of NCCU-CS Linear Algebra week 12.

## Intro

This is 108703015's Linear Algebra homework.  

 - [Introspection](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/tree/master/week12#introspection)

### Working environments

 - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Python version: 3.6.9

## Introspection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this week's course, Mr.Tsai has taught us the following topics:

1. The definition of orthogonal matrix, orthonormal basis, and orthogonal complement.
2. Inner Product and orthogonal projections.
3. Find the projection matrix

This part is quite useful. It can be used to get the distance between two items in a space, which is also used in my computer graphics homework.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me: *"Why do you want to finish your homework in this form? It spent much more time than the normal ways!"*  
I will give you the answer: *"Because I think this is cool, and I think this course is worthwhile to spent time on. That's it."*
