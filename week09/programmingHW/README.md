Linear Algebra Programming HW 06

## usage

codes [here](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/blob/master/week09/programmingHW/code.py).

```
python3 code.py
```

I recommend you to run these codes on a ___jupyter notebook___ or anything similar since terminal enviornments can't show the charts.  

## principle

So this is how my codes works:  



## Example
