Linear Algebra Programming HW 06

## usage

codes [here](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/blob/master/week09/programmingHW/code.py).

```
python3 code.py
```

I recommend you to run these codes on a ___jupyter notebook___ or anything similar since terminal enviornments can't show the charts.  

## principle

So this is how my codes works:  

First the user will insert a range for a rectangle, then I will fill the region with 30x30 points separated.

After that, the code will draw each points on a chart, which ranged from x=(-1.2\*max, 1.2\*max), y=(-1.2\*max, 1.2\*max) for max=max(eachX, eachY).



## Example

By using the inverse matrix of A, we can calculate the answers by mutiply them together.
