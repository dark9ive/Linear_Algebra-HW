### Working environments

 - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Python version: 3.6.9

## Introspection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this week's course, Mr.Tsai has taught us the following topics:

1. The definition of Linear mapping and Linear transformation.
2. The properties of Linear dependence.
3. Some examples of Linear combination.
4. Linear transformation and basis.
5. Transformation matrix and its examples.

This part is quite familiar to me, since part of it was learned in senior high, and was also used in my computer graphics homework. The computer graphics homework includes some matrix calculating a spinning cube, which used the technique of transformation matrix.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me: *"Why do you want to finish your homework in this form? It spent much more time than the normal ways!"*  
I will give you the answer: *"Because I think this is cool, and I think this course is worthwhile to spent time on. That's it."*
