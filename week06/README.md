# Week 06

Class review of NCCU-CS Linear Algebra week 6.

## Intro

This is 108703015's Linear Algebra homework.  

 - [Introspection](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/tree/master/week06#introspection)

### Working environments

 - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Python version: 3.6.9

## Introspection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this week's course, Mr.Tsai has taught us the following topics:

1. The definition of subspaces.
2. Linear independence and Linear dependence.
3. The definition of Linear combination.

This part is very important, since it connect with the course on the next week -- The rank of a matrix. Hope teacher can use programs to show some examples of real use. Otherwise I think this part is a bit difficult to understand.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me: *"Why do you want to finish your homework in this form? It spent much more time than the normal ways!"*  
I will give you the answer: *"Because I think this is cool, and I think this course is worthwhile to spent time on. That's it."*
