Linear Algebra Programming HW 02

## Story

During the plague, the residents are asked to stay at home. The residents can only go to the supermarket once a week.  
Each week, my parents asked me to buy some potatoes and tomatoes.  
However, I always forget the unit price of those groceries.  
Fortunately, I can calculate the total price by counting how much money was left in my wallet.  
So, I write this python code to help me calculate the unit price of those two items.  

## usage

```
python3 code.py
```
further instructions WIP.
