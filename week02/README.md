# Week 02

Class review of NCCU-CS Linear Algebra week 2.

## Intro

This is 108703015's Linear Algebra homework. Seperated into two parts:

 - [Homework](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/tree/master/week02#homework)
 - [Introspection](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/tree/master/week02#introspection)

### Working environments

 - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Python version: 3.6.9

## Homework

[Here's](https://github.com/dark9ive/Linear_Algebra-HW/blob/master/week01/homework02.py) the source code of this week's homework.  
Due to my lack in creativity, I don't know how to draw something fancy. Instead, I'll try my best on making a class review.

### Before we started...

If you want to tryout my code, make sure you have [python3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download), [numpy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html), and [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1654/) installed on your system. If you have no idea what they are, please click them for installing guides.

### Import library(s)

In the first two line, you will see:

```python
import numpy as npy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Their functions are importing **numpy** and **matplotlib** into my codes.

## Introspection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this week's course, Mr.Tsai has taught us some basics about the linear system and matrix in math. Although I've learned them in senior high school courses, I didn't realize that they have so much to do with the computer science. In addition, numpy provides a convenient environment for us to finish those related calculations, including matrix add/subtract/multiplication, discriminate solution(s) of a linear system...etc. This part is way more different from the senior high school course. In senior high, the main goal is to learn how to do such operations, which is really boring. In Mr.Tsai's class, we use techniques to complete those tasks, and put our attention on discussing math problems, which is more useful.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me: *"Why do you want to finish your homework in this form? It spent much more time than the normal ways!"*  
I will give you the answer: *"Because I think this is cool, and I think this course is worthwhile to spent time on. That's it."*
